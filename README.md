# Algorithm Analysis and Design

This is a school assignment to analyse and test algorithms, including quick sort and radix sort.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* [Codeblocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads) - IDE
Or
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - Code editor
* [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) - Compiler

### Installing

Download the software from the link given above.

For MinGW compiler, you have to set environment variable. 

1. Right-click on your "My Computer" icon and select "Properties".
2. Click on the "Advanced" tab, then on the "Environment Variables" button.
3. You should be presented with a dialog box with two text boxes. The top box shows your user settings. The PATH entry in this box is the one you want to modify. Note that the bottom text box allows you to change the system PATH variable. You should not alter the system path variable in any manner, or you will cause all sorts of problems for you and your computer!
4. Click on the PATH entry in the TOP box, then click on the "Edit" button
5. Scroll to the end of the string and at the end add
```
;<installation-directory>\bin
```
6. press OK -> OK -> OK and you are done.

Then you are good to go.
